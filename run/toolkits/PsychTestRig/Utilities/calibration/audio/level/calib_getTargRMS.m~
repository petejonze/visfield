function Xrms=calib_getTargRMS(calib,targLeq,outChans,freq,tolerance,devID,devName,headID)
% GETRMS Returns a target RMS power level required to attain the specified
% Leq (SPL), as determined by a previously obtained calibration file.
%
%   Uses a linear regression (Leq regressed onto log10(rms)) backwards.
%
%   Currently if freq is -1 then it will attempt to find a whitenoise
%   calibration
%
% @Parameters:             
%
%     	calib                   Struct/Char    	Either calib structure or name of file to load (including relative or absolute path if not in current directory)
%                                e.g. './calibrations/calib-1234.mat'
%     	targLeq                 Real         	Desired output level
%                                e.g. 64
%     	outChans                 Int             #####
%                                e.g. 0
%     	freq                    Real            Expected headphone ID
%                                e.g. 1000
%     	[tolerance]             Real            see calib_getFreqIndex()
%                                e.g.
%     	[devID]                 Int             Expected device ID
%                                e.g. 1
%     	[devName]               Char            Expected device name
%                                e.g. 'C-Media USB Headphone Set'
%     	[headID]                Char            Expected headphone name
%                                e.g. 'Sen-ME4'
% @Returns:  
%
%    	Xrms       	Real      The rms value required to obtain the desired output level. RMS is the square root of the arithmetic mean (average) of the squares of the original values
%

% @Usage:           Xrms=calib_getTargRMS(calib, targLeq, outChans, freq, [tolerance], [devID], [devName], [headID])   
% @Example:         Xrms=calib_getTargRMS(myCalib, 30, 1, -1)
